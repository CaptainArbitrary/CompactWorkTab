If you have a smaller screen or mods that add a lot of work types (like my own [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3013527266]Many Jobs[/url] for instance) you may have encountered the heartbreak of the unreadable Work tab.

This mod is very simple. It rotates the column labels by 90Â° to make a crowded Work tab more usable.

And as a bonus feature, [b]free gratis[/b], the mod enables scroll-wheel support for incrementing or decrementing work priorities. Just put your cursor over a priority box and scroll up or down. If manual priorities are disabled, scrolling will toggle the work type for the selected pawn. If manual priorities are on, scrolling up will raise the work type's priority, and scrolling down will lower it.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
This mod is has been tested and found to be nicely compatible with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1414302321]Numbers[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1994006442]Priority Master[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2340773428]Grouped Pawns Lists[/url]. It's [i]technically[/i] also compatible with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=725219116]Fluffy's Work Tab[/url] (from which this mod took inspiration), but if you run them both at the same time Fluffy's mod will override the functionality of this one, so I recommend you don't do that.

[h1]A Note about Numbers[/h1]

Because of how Numbers works, this mod interacts in an interesting way with it. If your Numbers tab includes work types, the work type column headers will be drawn vertically. Here's Numbers without this mod:
