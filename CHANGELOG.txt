Release 1.1.2

Enhancements

Moved texture loading out of DoHeader prefix and into a static class (PR #33)
- Removed local fields SortingIcon and SortingDescendingIcon out of PawnColumnWorker_WorkPriority_DoHeader
- Added them to a static Textures class
- Changed references in PawnColumnWorker_WorkPriority_DoHeader to point to the Texture class instead of the local fields

Improved inclined column headers (PR #34)
- Added a little extra space to the right-hand side of the work tab to make room for inclined labels
- Improved the alignment of inclined labels over their columns (high-school trigonometry, baby)
- Improved compatibility with Grouped Pawns Lists

Release 1.1.1

Enhancements

Minor improvements to inclined labels (PR #31)
- Significantly refactored the code and clarified the key algorithms
- Repositioned inclined labels to make them less derpy looking
- Added lines under the labels to make the table easier to read

Release 1.1.0

New Features

Added an experimental option to lay out labels at a 60° angle (PR #29)
- The option is off by default
- With the option off, the mod behaves in exactly the same way it did before
- With it on, column labels are inclined to a 60° angle
- Also, header highlighting is disabled if inclined headers are turned on

Enhancements

Add GapTiny × 2 padding to Cache.MinHeaderHeight (PR #28)

Release 1.0.1

New Features

Added mod options (PR #16)

Enhancements

Used Krafs Publicizer to eliminate some Invoke() calls and improve performance (PR #15)

Patched CalculateHeaderHeight instead of GetMinHeaderHeight (PR #17)
PawnTable.CalculateHeaderHeight is called once while PawnColumnWorker_WorkPriority is called N times where N is the number of work priority columns in the table. We only need one.

Added compatibility with Grouped Pawns Lists (PR #19)
