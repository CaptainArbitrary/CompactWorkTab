- With it on, column labels are inclined to a 60° angle
- Also, header highlighting is disabled if inclined headers are turned on

Enhancements

Used Krafs Publicizer to eliminate some Invoke() calls and improve performance (PR #15)

Patched CalculateHeaderHeight instead of GetMinHeaderHeight (PR #17)
PawnTable.CalculateHeaderHeight is called once while PawnColumnWorker_WorkPriority is called N times where N is the number of work priority columns in the table. We only need one.

Added compatibility with Grouped Pawns Lists (PR #19)
